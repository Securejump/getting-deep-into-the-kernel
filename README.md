welcome to the notes and slides of the "Bajando el nivel: metiendo manos en el kernel Linux" talk. to begin, i advise:

- downloading and installing the following packages:
    - gdb
    - make
    - c
    - cmake
    - glibc static libraries
- read the talk and be ready.
    - keep the notes at hand. you'll need them :)
