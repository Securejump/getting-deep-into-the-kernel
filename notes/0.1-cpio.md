generating a cpio is not hard, but we do need to keep some things in consideration.

```
# we need an init binary/script.
# for testing, i usually go with bash.
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-5.3.tar.gz
tar xfv bash-5.3.tar.gz
cd bash5.3
# we run the configure command to make the build be static.
# this is needed because in a clean Linux environment we don't have
# any kind of dynamic libraries. now, this of course requires the
# installation of static libraries. you may google the ones required
# for your distro.
./configure --enable-static-link
make clean
make -j$(nproc)
mv bash init
mkdir cpio
mv init cpio
cd cpio
ls | cpio -H newc -o > initram.cpio
cd linux/source/code/path
qemu-system-x86_64 \
-m 2G \
-kernel linux_source_code/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \
-initrd /path/to/initram.cpio \
-s \
-S
```
